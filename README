This a lightweight form generation module, which can be used with either
CGI.pm (version 2 or 3), or (inside mod_perl) Apache::Request.
The module provides similar facilities to CGI.pm's HTML tag generation
routines, but is restricted to form field generation tags, with sticky values.
Also, the interface is not so flexible as CGI.pm's, in order to keep the code
size down.

Changes since version 0.05:
  Add well_formed() method to control trailing slash in elements
	(unfortunately defaults to false - thanks, Netscape)
  Make sure everything is otherwise XHTML compliant
  Fix text() and textarea() examples



This module is copyright 2001 Peter Haworth. You may use and distribute this
module according to the same terms as Perl is distributed under.
